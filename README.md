# Firefly Grid Simulation

This is a simple JavaScript program that simulates the movement of a firefly within a grid.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the code files.
3. Run the following command:  node firefly_grid_simulation.js


4. Watch the firefly (*) move around the grid!

## Customization

You can customize the grid size or the speed of the firefly's movement by modifying the constants `ROW`, `COL`, and the `setTimeout` delay in the code file (`firefly_grid_simulation.js`).
